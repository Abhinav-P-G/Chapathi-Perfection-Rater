### Project Description
1. Chapati Roundness and Spot Detection
This module uses computer vision techniques to analyze chapati images for two key quality factors: roundness and surface defects. The image is preprocessed, edges are detected, and contours are analyzed to calculate a roundness score. HSV color filtering and morphological operations are applied to detect and highlight surface spots or burns. The system helps in automated quality grading for food inspection.

2. Marigold Petal Counter
This module automatically counts the petals of a marigold flower from an input image. Using HSV color filtering to isolate the yellow-orange hue range, the system extracts the flower‚Äôs contour and generates an angular histogram. Peaks in this histogram represent individual petals, which are then counted after smoothing and merging nearby peaks. This can be used in agricultural research, plant health monitoring, and yield studies.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every day, millions suffer in silence‚Ä¶ from slightly oval chapatis and marigolds with petal counts that are probably fine. Dinner tables across the world are plagued by imperfectly round bread, and gardens are filled with flowers whose petal numbers go unverified. How can humanity truly progress if we don‚Äôt know whether our chapati is perfectly circular or if our marigold meets the ‚Äúideal petal standard‚Äù?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We bring you the ultimate fusion of culinary and botanical precision: a computer vision system that checks the roundness of chapatis and counts marigold petals ‚Äî because why should bread and flowers escape scientific scrutiny? With finely tuned HSV filters, edgy Canny magic, and a petal-detecting angular histogram, we ensure your dinner and your garden both pass our absurdly high standards. It‚Äôs quality control‚Ä¶ where quality control was never needed.
